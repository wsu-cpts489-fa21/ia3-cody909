## Reflections
One struggle I had with this assignment again had to to with TestCafé, we had to write tests for keyboard functions but they didn't work and additionally TestCafé had a problem where it couldn't properly verify minimum character requirements for the input fields on the forms. I spent a lot of time reading through TestCafé documentation and looking to see if anyone else had the same problem on stack overflow but couldn't find a workaround. Another thing I struggled with was creating the dialog form for resetting a password but I was able to work through it by examining the create account dialog to figure out how everything worked. The most challenging thing for me with this assignment was working with the toast notifications from bootstrap, the styling was having problems where it wasn't aligning how I wanted it to and since there were so many classes involved I had to do a lot of reading on what they all do in order to understand what the problem was. And the most fun part of the assignment for me was inserting a green check next to valid responses and a red error next to invalid ones, I like to make design choices like this and it was fun looking up all the possible html symbols that are available.

## Notes
Note some tests fail becuase of issues with testcafe. Its pressKey() function doesn't work properly and it has a problem with validating minimum input length requirement for the forms where it accepts input that does not meet minimum length requirement
